## PyTorch implementation of Reinforcement learning algorithms

This repository contains : 
  1. Value-Based Methods : (Neural Q-Learning, DQN, Double-DQN, Memory improved DQN)
  2. Policy-Based Methods:

## Important notes
    The code works for PyTorch.
    The agents interact with OpenAI gym and Unity environments.

## Features
    Support CUDA.(Faster than CPU implementation)
    Support discrete and continous state space.    
    Support discrete and continous action space.
